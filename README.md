# whatsapp
A chatting app (distributed, yet run locally)



## Goal 1
Setup a single nodejs chat server as docker container, with ability to chat using websockets. I should be able to send a ping to it and get a pong back.
The way to launch this server should be single line command to launch a docker conatiner. Dev contribution should also be easy. Contribute and build the image and run the container.
### Steps
1. Folder for chat server
2. Code for chat server with websockets
3. Docker stuff
4. Create image and run as container
5. Ping on port xyz, and get a response, via a wscat app
